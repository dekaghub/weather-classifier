## Keras MobileNet V1 Weather Classifier

I attempted to use the pretrained MobileNet V1 classifier to quickly train on a simple [weather dataset](http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/4drtyfjtfy.1) that has 4 classes (Cloudy, Rainy, Sunshine & Sunrise) to train and test.

This was a relatively fast project since the data was easy to setup with the Keras ImageDataGenerator and the model was fast to train with 2.67 million parameters.

I am amazed by the performance of this very lightweight model since it performed really well with a limited dataset for training.
